# Commit Convention

`Tag` (`Scope`): `Message`

The `Tag` should be in the list above

The `Scope` should define the context of the affected changes.

The `Message` should not be confused with git commit message.

The `Tag` is one of the following:

- `Build:`-> Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (docker, npm, make…)

- `CI:`-> Changes concerning the integration or configuration files and scripts (Travis, Ansible, BrowserStack ...)

- `Feat:`-> Added new functionality

- `Fix:`-> Bug fix

- `Perf:`-> Performance improvement

- `Refactor:`-> Modifications which brings neither new functionality nor performance improvement

- `Style:`-> Changes that brings no functional or semantic alteration (indentation, formatting, adding space, renaming of a variable ...)


- `Upgrade:`-> Internal dependency upgrade 

- `Docs:`-> Writing or updating documentation

- `Test:`-> Adding or modifying tests

- The `scope` should define the context of the affected changes.

- The `message` summaries description of the change in one sentence.

Examples:

```
Feat (frontend): Added /category route to access images by category.
Fix (database): Added migration to correct category structure.
CI (backend): Added linter tests
```
