The `Scope` should define the context of the affected changes.

- `Upgrade:`-> Internal dependency upgrade 

- `Docs:`-> Writing or updating documentation

- `Test:`-> Adding or modifying tests

- The `scope` should define the context of the affected changes.

- The `message` summaries description of the change in one sentence.
